# GATE Practice Overlay

A lightweight Chrome Extension that enhances compatible online GATE-style question pages with a **clean practice interface and local answer evaluation**, allowing students to **re-attempt completed NPTEL-GATE mock tests** in a fresh exam-like environment.

This tool runs **entirely inside the user’s browser** and does not communicate with, modify, or access any external servers.  
It only changes how the page is displayed for the user — similar to dark mode, ad blockers, or reader mode.

## 🛡️ How it works

This extension works by:
- Reading the question and answer data **already present** in the webpage  
- Modifying only the **DOM (HTML / CSS / JavaScript)** inside your browser  

It does **NOT**:
- Access servers  
- Bypass logins or paywalls  
- Download protected content  
- Change any real exam data  

This is a **UI overlay**, not a scraper or a hack.
