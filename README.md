# GATE Practice Overlay

A lightweight Chrome Extension that enhances compatible online GATE-style question pages with a **clean practice interface and local answer evaluation**.

This tool runs **entirely inside the user’s browser** and does not communicate with, modify, or access any external servers.  
It only changes how the page is displayed for the user — similar to dark mode, ad blockers, or reader mode.

## 🛡️ How it works

This extension works by:
- Reading the question and answer data **already present** in the webpage
- Modifying only the **DOM (HTML/CSS/JS)** inside your browser
- It does **NOT**:
  - Access servers
  - Bypass logins
  - Download protected content
  - Change any real exam data

This is a **UI overlay**, not a scraper or a hack.
